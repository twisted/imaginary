"""
This module is a mid-level proof of concept of various features in Imaginary.

Currently its implementation is a bit messy and it assumes lots of things about
the reader's knowledge, but we are working on more thoroughly documenting it
and making it into a good example of how to build functionality that interacts
with multiple systems (currency, containment, object creation) in Imaginary.
