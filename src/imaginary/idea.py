class Idea(record("delegate linkers annotators")):
    """
    Consider a person's activities with the world around them as having two
    layers.  One is a physical layer, out in the world, composed of matter and
    energy. The other is a cognitive layer, internal to the person, composed
    of ideas about that matter and energy.

    For example, when a person wants to sit in a wooden chair, they must first
    visually locate the arrangement of wood in question, make the determination
    of that it is a "chair" based on its properties, and then perform the
    appropriate actions to sit upon it.

    However, a person may also interact with symbolic abstractions rather than
    physical objects.  They may read a word, or point at a window on a computer
    screen.  An L{Idea} is a representation of the common unit that can be
    referred to in this way.

    Both physical and cognitive layers are present in Imaginary.  The cognitive
    layer is modeled by L{imaginary.idea}.  The physical layer is modeled by a
    rudimentary point-of-interest simulation in L{imaginary.objects}.  An
    L{imaginary.thing.Thing} is a physical object; an L{Idea} is a node in a
    non-physical graph, related by links that are annotated to describe the
    nature of the relationship between it and other L{Idea}s.

    L{Idea} is the most abstract unit of simulation.  It does not have any
    behavior or simulation semantics of its own; it merely ties together
    different related systems.

    An L{Idea} is composed of a C{delegate}, which is an object that implements
    simulation-defined interfaces; a list of L{ILinkContributor}s, which
    produce L{Link}s to other L{Idea}s, an a set of C{ILinkAnnotator}s, which
    apply annotations (which themselves implement simulation-defined
    link-annotation interfaces) to those links.

    Each L{imaginary.thing.Thing} has a corresponding L{Idea} to represent it
    in the simulation.  The physical simulation defines only a few types of
    links: objects have links to their containers, containers have links to
    their contents, rooms have links to their exits, exits have links to their
    destinations.  Any L{imaginary.thing.Thing} can have a powerup applied to
    it which adds to the list of linkers or annotators for its L{Idea},
    however, which allows users to create arbitrary objects.

    For example, the target of the "look" action must implement
    L{imaginary.iimaginary.IVisible}, but need not be a
    L{iimaginary.objects.Thing}.  A simulation might want to provide a piece of
    graffiti that you could look at, but would not be a physical object, in the
    sense that you couldn't pick it up, weigh it, push it, etc.  Such an object
    could be implemented as a powerup for both
    L{imaginary.iimaginary.IDescriptionContributor}, which would impart some
    short flavor text to the room, and L{imaginary.iimaginary.IVisible}, which
    would be an acceptable target of 'look'.  The
    L{imaginary.iimaginary.IVisible} implementation could even be an in-memory
    object, not stored in the database at all; and there could be different
    implementations for different observers, depending on their level of
    knowledge about the in-world graffiti.

    @ivar delegate: this object is the object which may be adaptable to a set
        of interfaces.  This L{Idea} delegates all adaptation to its delegate.
        In many cases (when referring to a physical object), this will be an
        L{imaginary.thing.Thing}, but not necessarily.

    @ivar linkers: a L{list} of L{ILinkContributor}s which are used to gather
        L{Link}s from this L{Idea} during L{Idea.obtain} traversal.
