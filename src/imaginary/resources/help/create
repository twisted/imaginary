CREATE

Usage: create [a | an | the] <type> named <name> [description]

Bring a new object of the specified type into existence, using the given name
and, if provided, the description.  If the "a" or "an" form is used, or if no
article is supplied, the resulting object's name will be considered a common
noun; if "the" is used, the name is considered a proper noun.  The object will
be created in your inventory.  Creation may fail if you are unable to carry it.
Anyone able to see you or the created object will witness the creation.  The
list of type available for creation is determined from the available
IObjectType plugins on the system.
