            provide some kind of C{ISpectrum} interface and the implementation
            of L{IElectromagneticMedium} should consult methods of that to
            determine the frequency that is relevant, etc.  Also, the basic
            perception interface should probably be something else.  Batman
            might use echo-location to perceive his environment (he's a bat,
            right?) so "look at Alice" shouldn't require that he can "see"
            Alice via L{IElectromagneticMedium} - he can "see" her via
            L{ISoundMedium} or whatever.
