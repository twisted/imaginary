    """
    A L{Thing} is a physically located object in the game world.

    While a game object in Imaginary is composed of many different Python
    objects, the L{Thing} is the central object that most game objects will
    share.  It's central for several reasons.

    First, a L{Thing} is connected to the point-of-interest simulation that
    makes up the environment of an Imaginary game.  A L{Thing} has a location,
    and a L{Container} can list the L{Thing}s located within it, which is how
    you can see the objects in your surroundings or a container.

    Each L{Thing} has an associated L{Idea}, which provides the graph that can
    be traversed to find other L{Thing}s to be the target for actions or
    events.

    A L{Thing} is also the object which serves as the persistent nexus of
    powerups that define behavior.  An L{_Enhancement} is a powerup for a
    L{Thing}.  L{Thing}s can be powered up for a number of different
    interfaces:

        - L{iimaginary.IMovementRestriction}, for preventing the L{Thing} from
          moving around,

        - L{iimaginary.ILinkContributor}, which can provide links from the
          L{Thing}'s L{Idea} to other L{Idea}s,

        - L{iimaginary.ILinkAnnotator}, which can provide annotations on links
          incoming to or outgoing from the L{Thing}'s L{Idea},

        - L{iimaginary.ILocationLinkAnnotator}, which can provide annotations
          on links to or from any L{Thing}'s L{Idea} which is ultimately
          located within the powered-up L{Thing}.

        - L{iimaginary.IDescriptionContributor}, which provide components of
          the L{Thing}'s description when viewed with the L{Look} action.

        - and finally, any interface used as a target for an action or event.

    The way this all fits together is as follows: if you wanted to make a
    shirt, for example, you would make a L{Thing}, give it an appropriate name
    and description, make a new L{Enhancement} class which implements
    L{IMovementRestriction} to prevent the shirt from moving around unless it
    is correctly in the un-worn state, and then power up that L{Enhancement} on
    the L{Thing}.  This particular example is implemented in
    L{imaginary.garments}, but almost any game-logic implementation will follow
    this general pattern.
